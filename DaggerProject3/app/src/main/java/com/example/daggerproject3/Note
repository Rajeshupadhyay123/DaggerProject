Uses of the @Singleton annotation

========================================
1--- In the module class with @Provides annotation
2--- In the module class with @Binds annotation
3---If in a class we are using the constructor Injection with @Inject annotation in that case we can
        use the @Singleton annotation in above of the class defination...

 =====================================
 But Note-----
  If we are using the @Singleton annotation then it is mandatory to use in component class in above
  of the @Component annotation..................................

  If we uses the multiple reference of the component class then our singleton object will also be recreated not reuse
  for exe:--
        MobileComponent component1 = DaggerMobileComponent.factory().create(4,3,64);
        MobileComponent component2 = DaggerMobileComponent.factory().create(4,3,64);
        MobileComponent component3 = DaggerMobileComponent.factory().create(4,3,64);

        Here there are three object reference of the component class then here 3 object of the Battery
        class will also be created it doesn't mean they are singleton.

  ==============================================
  Why we uses the Singleton------------
  If we will be use the singleton annotation, we does not need to recreate the object if they are already
  created. It also reuse the old one....................
